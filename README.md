### About This Project
This repository is a collaboration between various computer science students currently completing the assessment year at the [University of Zurich](https://www.oec.uzh.ch/en/studies/bachelor/it.html). Its main goal is to provide documented, functioning and divers sample solutions for fellow students seeking help in informatics.

To date, this project only includes tasks from the lecture _Informatics I_ which are being distributed over the ACCESS platform. In the future, it is planned to incorporate a handful of assignments, guides and information for other lectures.

### Contribution
There is nothing worse than being forced into a certain coding style. Having only one solution provided promotes exactly that. Create a pull request and share your solution now to contribute to a diverse range of styles and approaches. This is the only way we can make sure other students find a satisfactory answer to their questions. However, please make sure your solution receives the maximum amount of points possible on ACCESS.

Don't worry if you have never contributed to a GitHub repository. Read through [this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) official tutorial, which teaches you how to fork your own copy of this project and how to create a pull request. As a supplement to the guide, the download link for **git** can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Additionally, read the [these](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) official GitHub instructions on how to sync your fork with its original repository.

### Help
If you encounter any issue or would like to contribute to a specific problem without going through the process of creating a pull request, create an [issue](https://github.com/Perytron/UZH/issues) and I will aid you as soon as possible. For the non-GitHub users among you, write us directly in the WhatsApp chat "Informatik Jahrgang 22"
